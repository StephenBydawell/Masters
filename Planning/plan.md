#Masters Plan

##Pre-lim to Experiments

- [x] Heat-Transfer Co-effs calculated
- [ ] Heat-Transfer Co-effs optimised to steady-state differentials
- [ ] Optimise Creep curves
- [ ] Mesh convergence on creep schedule

##Small-scale Experiments

- [ ] Start-up
- [ ] Shut-down
- [ ] Steady-State
- [ ] Two-shifting (ideal)
- [ ] Plant data
- [ ] Graphs and Visuals

##Full-scale Experiments

- [ ] Steady-State
- [ ] Two-shifting (ideal)
- [ ] Plant data
