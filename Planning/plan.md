#Masters Plan

##Pre-lim to Experiments

- [x] Heat-Transfer Co-effs calculated
- [x] Heat-Transfer Co-effs optimised to steady-state differentials
- [ ] Optimise Creep curves
- [ ] Mesh convergence on creep schedule

###Mesh convergence schedule

| Tests         | Divisions     | R     |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

##Small-scale Experiments

- [ ] Start-up
- [ ] Shut-down
- [ ] Steady-State
- [ ] Two-shifting (ideal)
- [ ] Plant data
- [ ] Graphs and Visuals

##Full-scale Experiments

- [ ] Steady-State
- [ ] Two-shifting (ideal)
- [ ] Plant data
